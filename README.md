# COMM4190 Spring 2025 - Applying Expectancy Violations Theory to LLM Interactions
# Carlos Lama

As large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT become embedded in everyday communication, users increasingly form social and communicative expectations about how these systems should respond. When these expectations are violated—through unexpected humor, emotion, refusal, or personality shifts—user perceptions of trust, usefulness, and engagement may be altered. This study applies Expectancy Violations Theory (EVT) to analyze how such deviations influence human evaluations of LLM responses. Using a sampled survey of 32 participants reacting to eight carefully constructed LLM outputs—each representing a different type of communicative violation—we collected 256 data points measuring surprise, perceived usefulness, trust shifts, and emotional appropriateness. Results reveal that violations are not inherently negative: humor and light emotionality often increased engagement and trust, while blunt refusals or over-confident personalization reduced perceived credibility. These findings support EVT's premise that the reaction of a violation is mediated by the communicator's perceived reward value. The paper concludes with design recommendations for LLM developers, suggesting that adaptive tone, graceful refusals, and context-aware creativity can make violations feel welcome rather than disruptive.
